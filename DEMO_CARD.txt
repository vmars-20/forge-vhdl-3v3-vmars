Hi! I'd like to demonstrate the forge-vhdl workflow by creating a simple
VHDL component together. This will showcase the interactive requirements
gathering and automated agent workflow.

DEMO TASK:
----------
Create a "debouncer" component - removes mechanical switch noise by requiring
a stable signal for a specified duration before changing output.

Use case: Push button reads '1' when pressed, but mechanically bounces
(1-0-1-0-1) for ~10ms. Debouncer ensures clean single transition.

REQUIREMENTS TO GATHER:
-----------------------
You'll ask me questions across 7 phases:
1. Identification: Name (forge_util_debouncer), category (utilities)
2. Functionality: Stable time requirement, clock-based counter
3. Interface: Ports (clk, rst_n, noisy_in, clean_out), generics (STABLE_CYCLES)
4. Behavior: Counter-based FSM (UNSTABLE → COUNTING → STABLE)
5. Testing: P1 tests (reset, bounce filtering, stable detection)
6. Design: Counter architecture, no FORGE integration needed
7. Specification: Generate workflow/specs/pending/forge_util_debouncer.md

MY ANSWERS (for speed):
-----------------------
- Component: forge_util_debouncer (utilities category)
- Clock: 125 MHz system clock
- Stable time: Configurable via generic, default 1ms = 125,000 cycles
- Interface:
  * Inputs: clk, rst_n, noisy_in (std_logic)
  * Outputs: clean_out (std_logic)
  * Generics: STABLE_CYCLES (natural, default 125000)
- Behavior:
  * Count consecutive cycles where noisy_in is stable
  * Change clean_out only after STABLE_CYCLES of same value
  * Reset counter if noisy_in changes before reaching STABLE_CYCLES
- FSM States (as std_logic_vector):
  * "00" STABLE_LOW - output '0', input stable at '0'
  * "01" COUNTING_HIGH - counting cycles, input at '1'
  * "10" STABLE_HIGH - output '1', input stable at '1'
  * "11" COUNTING_LOW - counting cycles, input at '0'
- P1 Tests (3 essential):
  * Reset: All outputs = '0', state = STABLE_LOW
  * Bounce filtering: Apply 1-0-1-0-1 within STABLE_CYCLES → output stays '0'
  * Stable detection: Hold '1' for STABLE_CYCLES+1 → output becomes '1'
- Standards: VHDL-2008, std_logic_vector for states, rst_n active-low

EXPECTED WORKFLOW:
------------------
After you gather requirements and generate the specification:

1. You'll show me a specification summary
2. Ask: "Should I proceed with the 3-agent automated workflow?"
3. If I approve, you'll sequentially invoke:

   Agent 1: forge-vhdl-component-generator
   → Generates: vhdl/components/utilities/forge_util_debouncer.vhd
   → Output: Complete VHDL entity + architecture

   Agent 2: cocotb-progressive-test-designer
   → Analyzes: Generated VHDL file
   → Output: Test architecture, P1/P2 test strategy, expected values

   Agent 3: cocotb-progressive-test-runner
   → Implements: CocoTB test suite
   → Runs: Tests via GHDL simulation
   → Output: Test results (3/3 PASS expected)

4. You'll commit the specification and generated files

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-----------------
✅ Specification file created with all 7 phases documented
✅ VHDL file generated (entity + architecture, ~80-120 lines)
✅ Test suite created (P1 tests: reset, bounce filter, stable detect)
✅ Tests execute and PASS (if GHDL installed)
✅ All standards validated (no enums, std_logic_vector states, etc.)

READY?
------
Let's start! Begin by asking me Phase 1 questions (Component Identification).

Note: I've provided most answers above to speed up the demo, but feel free
to ask clarifying questions or suggest improvements to the design!
